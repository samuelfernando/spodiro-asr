052c0102_noisy FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING TO COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL

052c010y_noisy WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE
052c010z_noisy WELL TO BEGIN WITH MR. MILKEN ISN'T RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR FOR MR. CONGENIALITY
052c0110_noisy HE IS THE HEAD OF THE HUGE JUNK BOND OPERATION OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
052c0111_noisy AND MORE THAN THAT HE IS A CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY'S INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL

053c0103_noisy A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT SAID NO SUCH DECISION HAS BEEN MADE YET
053c0104_noisy IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY COULD HURT COMPETITORS
053c0105_noisy FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET
053c0106_noisy ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE
053c0107_noisy I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONALLY ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS WHICH TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
053c0108_noisy THE TASK FORCE REPORT ISN'T ALL BAD
053c0109_noisy IT DOES CALL FOR ELIMINATING SOME GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HEALTHY LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET
053c010a_noisy AND THE IDEA OF LETTING EMPLOYERS PRE FUND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES IS SURELY BETTER THAN HAVING GOVERNMENT DO IT
053c010b_noisy ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR TREASURY ISSUES LAST WEEK PLUNGED ABOUT THREE POINTS OR ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
053c010c_noisy PRICES WERE DOWN EVERY DAY BUT THURSDAY WHEN THEY ROSE ONLY SLIGHTLY

053c010p_noisy THE DOLLAR WAS LITTLE CHANGED
053c010q_noisy THE ASSESSMENT IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE NOW MARKET ANALYSTS SAY
053c010r_noisy ONE OF THE FEW AREAS OF STRONG GROWTH EARLIER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS THE NEW ISSUE MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES AND EQUITY RELATED BONDS
053c010s_noisy SUCH ACTIVITY HAS ALL BUT ENDED SINCE STOCK PRICES PLUNGED THE ANALYSTS SAY
053c010t_noisy INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FUELED THE RISE BY SHIFTING ASSETS TO THE FUNDS IN RESPONSE TO DECLINING RATES AVAILABLE ON SHORT TERM SECURITIES IN THE MARKET
053c010u_noisy ALSO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS' CONCERN OVER VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE SHE SAID

053c010z_noisy JOB SECURITY CLAUSES GIVE UNIONS SOMETHING POSITIVE TO TAKE BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS AT MODEST COST TO THE EMPLOYERS
053c0110_noisy BUT THEY CAN LOOK MORE GENEROUS THAN THEY ARE

053c0112_noisy WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THE BONDS IN JAPAN IN EUROPE IN THE U. K. BUT NOT IN THE U. S. MR. LABRECQUE SAID
053c0113_noisy THESE POWERS ARE IMPORTANT TO US

22gc0105_noisy EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HE SAYS
22gc0106_noisy THE TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD
22gc0107_noisy CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE CREDIT BUDGET
22gc0108_noisy A PILOT LOAN SALE PROGRAM APPROVED LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE A VIRTUALLY RISK FREE TEST OF THIS APPROACH
22gc0109_noisy INITIAL WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM HAS SURPRISED EVEN PRIVATIZATION ADVOCATES

22gc010q_noisy SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL
22gc010r_noisy CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE
22gc010s_noisy HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER
22gc010t_noisy BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES
22gc010u_noisy THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
22gc010v_noisy THE LOGIC APPARENTLY IS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE OUR RATES TO DEFEND THE DOLLAR SAID PETER CANELO A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT BEAR STEARNS
22gc010w_noisy BUT HE SAID THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE DOLLAR WERE WEAK
